# Website for react submission

My goal here is to build a react application using the React library as part of my assignment for stutern

##  List five significant features of React
- JSX(Javascript Syntax Extension)
- Virtual DOM
- One-way data binding
- Extensions
- Performance

## List five major advantages of React
- Easy to learn and use
- Creating dynamic web Applications becomes easier
- Reusable Components
- Performance Enhancement
- Scope for testing the codes

## What is the name of the Software Engineer that created React? Also, which company owns React?
- The software developer that created react is Jordan Walke and the company that owns react is Meta

## What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them
-You need to return a single parent element in JSX, while in HTML you can return whatever you want
-You can implement JS directly in JSX by putting the JS in {}, while in HTML you need acript tag or an external javascript file to implement Javascript
-All Tags can self-close in JSX, while just self-closing tags can self-close

## Why canâ€™t browsers read JSX?
-It is because JSX is not valid Javascript, browsers can't read it directly; they do not know what to do with it, so we need atranspiler to translate it to React.
